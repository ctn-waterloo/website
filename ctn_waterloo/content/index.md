Welcome to the Computational Neuroscience Research Group (CNRG) site. We are
one of the labs in the Waterloo [Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://ctn.uwaterloo.ca/).

We are interested in understanding how the brain works. We research
perception, action, cognition, and basic theoretical issues from a neural
perspective. Most of this research is carried out by building large-scale
models (usually simulating single neurons) of various brain areas. The main
software tool we use and develop for this purpose is
[Nengo](http://www.nengo.ca/). The book _How to build a brain_, which
summarizes much of our recent work, is now [available at
Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-
Architectures/dp/0199794545/).
We are currently offering the
[Nengo summer school](http://nengo.ca/summerschool)
on how to use Nengo to build large-scale brain models.

You can [download](http://nengo.ca/publications/spaunsciencepaper) our recent
Science paper called "A large-scale model of the functioning brain", or any of
our [other publications](/publications.html).
