Welcome to the Computational Neuroscience Research Group (CNRG) site. We are
one of the labs in the Waterloo [Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://ctn.uwaterloo.ca/).

We are interested in understanding how the brain works. We research
perception, action, cognition, and basic theoretical issues from a neural
perspective. Most of this research is carried out by building large-scale
models (usually simulating single neurons) of various brain areas. The main
software tool we use and developed for this purpose is
[Nengo](http://nengo.ai/). The books _Neural Engineering_ and _How to build a brain_ summarize the main
theoretical approaches we take. We recently proposed the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) and Spatial Semantic Pointers (SSPs)
based on our understanding of brain function. Both are helping to improve deep learning.

We are currently offering the
[Nengo summer school](https://www.nengo.ai/summer-school)
on how to use Nengo to build large-scale brain models.

You can find and download our [publications](/publications.html) on this site.
