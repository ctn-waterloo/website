## Tutoring Services

If you would like more personalized help for the assignments in this course, 
two of previous PhD students in the lab (Xuan Choo and Travis DeWolf) offer tutoring 
services.  They can be contacted at [ctntutoring@gmail.com](mailto:ctntutoring@gmail.com)
and they charge \$20 per half hour (or \$15 per person per half hour for groups).

##  Assignments

The four assignments will be posted here. 

 * Do not copy any code from other students or online sources.  You are expected to write your own code from scratch for this course.
 * Each student must write their own code and submit their own assignment.
 * Please hand in electronic copies by mailing them to me in .pdf format.  Please name the document like this: `<lastname>.Assignment<number>.pdf`.  This document will have all the graphs and any written answers to questions.
 * Include code, or any modified code, in a second document as well.  This should be in a single file (e.g. .zip) named similarly: `<lastname>.Assignment<numnber>.Code.zip`
 * Assignments are due _at Midnight_.  The late penalty is one mark per day it is late.

  * Assignment 1: [HTML](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/celiasmith/syde556/blob/master/Assignment%201.ipynb)
  * Assignment 2: [HTML](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/celiasmith/syde556/blob/master/Assignment%202.ipynb)
  * Assignment 3: [HTML](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/celiasmith/syde556/blob/master/Assignment%203.ipynb)
  * Assignment 4: [HTML](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/celiasmith/syde556/blob/master/Assignment%204.ipynb)

## Project Ideas

The final project for the course consists of picking a neurobiological system and
building a model for it.  There is a list of possible projects [here](/research/syde-750/syde-556-possible-projects.html),
but is not intended to be comprehensive, so feel free to come up with your own ideas.
Please have your projects approved by me by the beginning of Feb.  You will need to present your project idea in a couple of overhead slides to the class at the end of March.  These presentations are pass/fail. If you do not present you will lose 10 marks off your project report.

### Project Format

The project report should be in the format discussed in chapter 1 of the book
(see pp. 19-23; i.e., System Description, Design Specification,
Implementation). Students will also be expected to do a short (5-10min)
presentation on your topic in the last week or so.  That presentation should consist of a few slides (max 4), that sets up the problem and describes your expected approach. As with assignments, all code for projects must be submitted as well.

* * *

## Course Format

Two lectures per week and homework assignments consisting of computer
exercises using Matlab. For SYDE 750 a class project is required, usually a
computer simulation developed based on significant neuroscientific research
and/or collaboration with a neurophysiologist. For Syde 556 a class project
based on an in class/text example is required. This course examines a general
framework for modeling computation by neurobiological systems with an emphasis
on quantitative formulations. Particular emphasis will be placed on
understanding computation, representation, and dynamics in such systems.
Students will learn how the fundamentals of signal processing, control theory
and statistical inference, can be applied to modeling sensory, motor, and
cognitive systems.

## Course Prerequisites

Knowing how to program with matrices using MATLAB, Python, or some other language is highly 
recommended. Familiarity with Fourier Transforms and other signal processing concepts is recommended.
Familiarity with calculus and linear algebra is required.
