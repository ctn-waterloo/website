title: Experimental Neuroscience

Below is more information on experimental neuroscience; specifically, we have attempted to collect together the type of experimental information that is of interest to modelers.

Also see the following list of links to online resources of use for neural modelling.

  * http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/facts.html - Brain facts and figures

  * www.cs.dal.ca/~tt/papers/MLintro2012.pdf - Trappenburg's introduction to machine learning

  * http://senselab.med.yale.edu/NeuronDB/ - An excellent database of anatomical and physiological properties of neurons

  * www.cocomac.org - a comprehensive database of cortical-cortical connections in macaque

  * www.random.org - a site that provides truly random numbers for simulations

  * www.g2conline.org/2022 - 3D brain atlas

  * www.med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/cases/caseNA/pb9.htm - synchronized horizontal/coronal/sagittal MRI scans with brain structures labelled
