The NEF is the main method we use for constructing neural simulations. A quick
overview of the framework can be found below. The book [Neural
Engineering](http://www.amazon.com/Neural-Engineering-Representation-
Neurobiological-Computational/dp/0262550601/) from MIT Press is
a full description of the framework. However, we are constantly working on
improving and extending these methods.

Our group is developing a general computational framework for modeling the
function of complex neural ensembles. The framework is grounded in the well-
established principles of signal processing, statistical inference, and good
engineering design. It provides a rational and robust strategy for simulating
and evaluating the function of a wide variety of specific neural circuits. We
are currently applying this framework to specific projects in sensory
processing, motor control, and cognitive function.

Specific features of our modeling approach:

* Provides a novel characterization of population-temporal coding that combines population vectors with linear decoding of neural spikes;
* Unifies control (and dynamic systems) theory with biologically plausible, spiking models of neural function;
* Provides a general way to generate circuits that have analytically determined synaptic weights that provide a desired functionality;
* Promotes the formulation of specific hypotheses about circuit function and about key design constraints.
