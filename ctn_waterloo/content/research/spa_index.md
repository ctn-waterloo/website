intro: >
  Semantic pointers are neural representations that carry
  partial semantic content and are composable into the representational
  structures necessary to support complex cognition. These pages describe a
  cognitive architecture based on them. This architecture has been used to build
  the world's largest functional brain model, Spaun.

    - Semantic Pointer Architecture

The book
[How to build a brain](http://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-Architectures/dp/0199794545/)
from Oxford University Press
was published in Spring 2013.
It exploits the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF)
to develop the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA)
for cognitive modelling.
Semantic pointers are symbol-like structures that
are implemented in a subsymbolic architecture;
one can think of this as a
[synthesis](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hot-thought/201306/the-new-synthesis-in-cognitive-science)
of prior approaches in cognitive science.

The book provides tutorials in [Nengo](http://nengo.ca)
to explain and demonstrate many
of the central concepts discussed in the book.
Information that supports the book by providing
links to models, demos, videos, and tutorials mentioned in the book,
as well as a summary of the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA),
can be found on the [Nengo website](http://nengo.ca/build-a-brain).
