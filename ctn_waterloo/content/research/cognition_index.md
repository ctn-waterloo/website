intro: >
    Research into neural mechanisms behind many cognitive phenomena, 
    including working memory, syntactic generalization, structured representations, 
    associative memory, and more.


We're all about relating that high level cognitive processes to neurons.

We did Raven's.

We did counting strategies.

We did word search stuff.

We did planning.

(Is there something else I'm forgetting? Can I put RL stuff here?)
