intro: Important information we often refer to when modelling.

toc:
    - Membrane time constant (tau_rc)
    - Neurotransmitter Time Constants (PSCs)
    - Non Linear Pyramidal Cells
    - Number of Inhibitory Interneurons
    - Spike Rates
    - Typical Number of Inputs
    - Experimental Neuroscience Links
    - Glossary of Neuroscience Terms

We attempt to match our models to the properties of actual neurons.
This set of pages is meant to collect important information about actual neurons,
along with relevant citations and links.
