I joined the lab in September 2019 as a PhD student. I completed my Masters in Computational Mathematics at UW in April 2019 and my Honours BSc. in Mathematics and Physics at McMaster University. I am interested in spiking neuron models of grids cells and spatial memory. Grid cells are neurons found in the dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex that have a unique hexagonal firing pattern and are believed to be involved in path integration.
