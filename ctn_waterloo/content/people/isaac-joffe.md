I joined the Computational Neuroscience Research Group (CNRG) in September 2024 as an MMath student in Computer Science. Prior to this, I earned a BSc in Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta. I am interested in how the brain completes high-level and complex cognitive tasks with flexibility and generality.
