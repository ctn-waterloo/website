I joined the Computational Neuroscience Research Group (CNRG) in September 2024 as an MMath student in Computer Science. Prior to this, I earned a BSc in Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta.

I am broadly interested in intelligence, biological and artificial. I want to learn how the brain flexibly completes complex cognitive tasks and apply these ideas to develop cognitively plausible neuro-symbolic AI systems. My research goal is to solve the [Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artficial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI)](https://arcprize.org), an extremely difficult&mdash;and largely unsaturated&mdash;benchmark that tests fluid, not crystalline, intelligence.
