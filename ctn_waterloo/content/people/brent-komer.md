I joined the lab in May 2013 as an intern, and then started my Masters in Computer Science with the lab in September 2013. I received my BASc. (Hons) in Mechatronics Engineering with a minor in Cognitive Science from the University of Waterloo.

I am interested in how the brain creates and uses representations of space, as well as perception and mental imagery. I've been experimenting with the RatSLAM algorithm and have been working on building a similar model with spiking neurons. I'm still working on finding a specific research topic.
