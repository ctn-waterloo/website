I joined the lab in March 2025 as a postdoctoral researcher to help build the next version of Spaun. I focus on spiking deep neural networks, motor control, navigation, perception and cognition to develop a large-scale spiking whole-brain model.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the newly founded Machine Intelligence and Robotics Lab of Prof. Arne Roennau at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
In June 2023 I defended my PhD thesis at the FZI Research Centre for Information Technology with Prof. Ruediger Dillmann. In my PhD thesis, I developed methods for flexible, reactive motion control in robotics, using event-based stereo vision for exteroception and a neural representation of the configuration space for path planning. I received a master's degree in computer science from KIT in 2017, and a bachelor's degree in medical informatics from Mannheim University of Applied Sciences in 2014.
