I am a PhD student in Systems Design Engineering. I completed my BASc in Electrical Engineering, Mechatronics Option, with a minor in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in 2023. My research began with the goal of developing control theory techniques derived from neural architectures to address challenges in robustness and power efficiency. I then shifted my focus to Model Predictive Control (MPC), particularly in applications for autonomous vehicles. Currently, I am collaborating with Mercedes-Benz to develop a fully neuromorphic, end-to-end self-driving vehicle control pipeline.
