I joined the lab in January 2025 as a postdoctoral fellow to help build the next version of Spaun, towards eluciding the neural mechanisms underlying the essential capacities of brains embedded in an interactive and dynamic environment. 
Before this, I conducted postdoctoral research into biologically-plausible anomaly detection and reinforcement learning algorithms with Dr. Jeff Orchard (Cheriton School of Computer Science) and Dr. Terrence C. Stewart (Natural Research Council of Canada).
My formal training is in Electrical Engineering (Memorial University, 2014), and in my Masters' and PhD (University of Calgary, 2016 and 2022, respectively), I investigated the role of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in guiding the expression of innate defensive and natural behaviors using a variety of systems neuroscience and computational approaches.
