I am a Ph.D. candidate in Systems Design Engineering. The adaptation of the brain to the dynamically changing environment fascinates me! I’m primarily interested in creating models describing the neural control of movement. I study the different algorithms the brain utilises to perceive, predict and adapt to its surroundings using various sensory information.

Prior to joining the lab in September of 2018, I worked as a research assistant in Motor Behavior Lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where I did my masters thesis studying reaching under different feedback conditions. 

When I’m not working I paint, code up random stuff and spend hours online watching drone racing videos!
