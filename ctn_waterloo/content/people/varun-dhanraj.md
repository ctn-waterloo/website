I started my Masters in Computer Science at the lab in September 2023, and received my BASc in Mathematical Physics from the University of Waterloo. I am currently working on improving the reasoning and planning capabilities of AI agents using strategies and concepts from reinforcement learning, large language models, and diffusion models.
