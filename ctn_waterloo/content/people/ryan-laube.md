### Research

I started my masters in Computer Science with the lab in January 2023 after completing my Honours BSc in Combined Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Regina. For my current research, I am interested in integrating external knowledge graphs with large language models using semantic pointers for question answering and logical reasoning.
