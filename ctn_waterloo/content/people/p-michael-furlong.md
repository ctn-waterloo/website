I joined the lab in October 2020 as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow.  Prior to this I was a contractor at NASA Ames Research Center's Intelligent Robotics Group. There I worked on automated flood mapping, life detection, and automated exploration for planetary robotics.
I earned my Ph.D in robotics in 2018 from Carnegie Mellon University, M.Sc. in Neuroscience from Oxford in 2011, M.Sc. Robotics from CMU in 2010, and B.Eng from Memorial University in 2005.
