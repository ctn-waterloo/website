## Academics

> University of Waterloo Master of Applied Science (MASc, thesis), 2012
Systems Design Engineering

> University of Toronto Honours Bachelor of Science (HBSc), 2010 Chemical
Physics (Specialist)

I began my undergraduate training in life science with a leaning to molecular
biology. Realizing that nature does not categorize disciplines the way
universities do, I moved to a combined chemistry and physics program to better
understand the quantitative modelling of living and non-living systems. The
common language in which these models are expressed is mathematics, and thus
I've developed a great appreciation for the art. At Toronto, I was fortunate
enough to work in R.J. Dwayne MillerÂ’s lab on a project related to the
ultrafast laser control of quantum coherent properties of a photosynthetic
protein complex that I isolated (LHC-II).

## Current Research

I have recently completed my MASc thesis, entitled
"A mechanistic model of motion processing in the early visual system."
