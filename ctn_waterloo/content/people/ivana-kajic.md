I am interested in biologically constrained representations of language. In
particular, I investigate distributed representations of words and sentences
that can be implemented efficiently in a network of spiking neurons. Also, I am
interested in making neural networks better at supporting natural language by
investigating human language acquisition and development.

Apart from brains, computers and robots I am also interested in programming
education.
