Pawels' research interests are in the field of low power artificial intelligent systems. His work ranges from running these systems in simulation (CoppeliaSim, Mujoco, Airsim, Pygame) to real robotics (robotic arms and drones). The low power abilities are directly due to the neuromorphic modelling approach, first outlined in the Neural Engineering Framework. The algorithms Pawel focus' on are for adaptive motor control and visual navigation. The aim for his thesis is to develop a low power visual navigation system, through the coupling of Legendre Memory Units and feature extraction, capable of multi-scale temporal processing.
