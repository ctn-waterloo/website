I joined the lab in September 2025 as a Master's student in Computer Science (MMath in CS). I earned my B.Eng.BME in Software and Biomedical Engineering from McMaster University, Hamilton, ON. I am researching distributional reinforcement learning (RL) techniques that can be translated to trustworthy, low-power autonomous agents through a neuromorphic approach.
