My research interests are mostly focused on extending the
Neural Engineering to work with more detailed neuron models, and using adaptive control and
filtering as a model of motor control and sensory inference in the brain.

Regarding my work on more detailed neuron models, I have been working on incorporating simple
multi-compartment models with conductance-based synapses into the NEF. The more complex interaction
between excitation and inhibition can be systematically exploited to compute functions such as
multiplication. Most of this work has been implemented in [NengoBio](https://github.com/astoeckel/nengo-bio),
an extension library for Nengo facilitating the construction of biologically constrained models.
I have adapted some of this work to construct a model of eyeblink conditioning the cerebellum.

Regarding my work on adaptive control and filtering, I am working on constructing neurobiologically plausible
artificial agents. I'm particularly focusing on sensory processing hierachies based on adaptive state observers.

Apart from these focus areas, I am interested in a broad range of topics including–but not limited to
–neuromorphic hardware, neurorobotics, and unsupervised learning strategies.

I have been teaching [SYDE 556/750 "Simulating Neurobiological Systems"](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/courses/syde-750.html) in Winter 2020.

Prior to joining the CNRG in January 2017, I have been a research assistant at the
[Cognitronics and Sensor Systems Group](http://www.ks.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/) in Bielefeld,
Germany, where I worked on neuromorphic hardware benchmarks and associative memory as part of the
[HBP neuromorphics subproject](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/silicon-brains/).

In my free time, I am either reading, building free software, tinkering with electronics,
writing terrible German fantasy novels, or wandering around aimlessly, getting lost.
