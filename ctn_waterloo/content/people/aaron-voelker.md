I started my masters in Computer Science at the lab in September 2013. I received my BMath Double Honours in Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization from the University of Waterloo, and have had software development internships at companies such as Google, Amazon, and ContextLogic.

I am interested in understanding how various levels of learning relate to functional brain development. However, my specific research goals are currently under development.
