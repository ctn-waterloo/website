## Background

I started as a Masters Student here at the University of Waterloo conducting research under the Computational Neuroscience Research Group (CNRG) in September 2024. I was awarded my BASc in June 2023 from the University of Waterloo in Mechatronics Engineering with a Computing Option. I have particular interests in neuroscience and software development, making CNRG an ideal place for me to pursue my Masters research.

## Research 

I am most interested in the neuroscience of conceptual representations and their dynamics within the conscious and unconscious mind. One of the key aspects of this is understanding how exactly concepts, events, experiences, etc. are captured, extracted, consolidated, and stored in memory. In particular, I'm interested in the links between attentive (a.k.a. working), experiential (a.k.a. episodic), and consolidated (a.k.a. long-term) memory mechanisms.

Understanding how these mechanisms interact in their neuroscientific aspects is imperative for developing any plausible theory or model of memory. Of related interest is how the mind "extracts" or learns new concepts from consolidated representations that can then be recalled at will. This includes the binding between language and conceptual representations -- something that occurs rapidly in children between the ages of 2 and 5. Further, modeling and understanding how different developmental conditions can impact memory and concept or language recall is something I am hoping to one day explore.
