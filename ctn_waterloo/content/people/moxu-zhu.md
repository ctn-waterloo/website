I joined the cnrg lab in Septmember 2025 as a MASc student in Systems Design Engineering. I earned my BASc in Engineering at Western University with interests in integrated, embedded, and interconnected systems as well as communication technologies, systems, and networks.

I am particularly interested in bridging biologically inspired learning (spiking neural networks, reinforcement learning) with intelligent control, with applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and adaptive systems.
