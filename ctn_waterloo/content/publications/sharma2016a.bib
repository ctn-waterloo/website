  abstract={In this paper, we present a spiking neural model of context
            dependent decision making. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a
            fundamental role in context dependent behaviour. We model
            the PFC at the level of single spiking neurons, to explore the
            underlying computations which determine its contextual responses.
            The model is built using the Neural Engineering
            Framework and performs input selection and integration as a
            nonlinear recurrent dynamical process. The results obtained
            from the model closely match behavioural and neural experimental
            data obtained from macaque monkeys that are trained
            to perform a context sensitive perceptual decision task. The
            close match suggests that the low-dimensional, nonlinear dynamical
            model we suggest captures central aspects of context
            dependent decision making in primates.
