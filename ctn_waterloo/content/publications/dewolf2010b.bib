  abstract = {This poster presents the Neural Optimal Control Hierarchy (NOCH), a framework based on optimal control theory and hierarchical control systems that takes advantage of recent developments in the field to map function to neurobiological components of the motor control system in the brain. An implementation of the NOCH controlling an arm model is shown to mimic human arm reach trajectories and account for various kinds of damage to the brain, including Huntington{\textquoteright}s disease and cerebellar damage.},
