  abstract = {The ability to flexibly route information between brain regions is crucial to perform new multi-step tasks. The mechanisms postulated by the global neuronal workspace theory of consciousness are thought to underlie this ability. We developed a spiking neural architecture based on the theory, which is able to route concepts in order to perform a cognitive task composed of chained operations.},
