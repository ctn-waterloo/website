    abstract= {We explore and evaluate biologically-inspired representations for an adaptive controller using Spatial Semantic
    Pointers (SSPs). Specifically, we show our method for place-cell-like SSP representations outperforms past methods. Using this
    representation, we efficiently learn the dynamics of a given plant
    over its state space. We implement this adaptive controller in
    a spiking neural network along with a classical sliding mode
    controller and prove the stability of the overall system despite
    non-linear plant dynamics. We then simulate the controller on a
    3-link arm and demonstrate that the proposed representational
    method gives a simpler and more systematic way of designing the
    neural representation of the state space. Compared to previous methods, we show an increase of 1.23-1.25x in tracking accuracy.},
