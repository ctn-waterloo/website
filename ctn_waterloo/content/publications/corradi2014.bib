  abstract={Brain-inspired, spike-based computation in electronic
systems is being investigated for developing alternative,
non-conventional computing technologies. The Neural Engineering
Framework provides a method for programming these devices
to implement computation. In this paper we apply this approach
to perform arbitrary mathematical computation using a mixed
signal analog/digital neuromorphic multi-neuron VLSI chip. This
is achieved by means of a network of spiking neurons with
multiple weighted connections. The synaptic weights are stored
in a 4-bit on-chip programmable SRAM block. We propose a
parallel event-based method for calibrating appropriately the
synaptic weights and demonstrate the method by encoding and
decoding arbitrary mathematical functions, and by implementing
dynamical systems via recurrent connections.},
