  abstract = {We believe that a Standard Model of the Mind should take into account continuous state representations, continuous timing, continuous actions, continuous learning, and parallel control loops. For each of these, we describe initial models that we have made exploring these directions. While we have demonstrated that it is possible to construct high-level cognitive models with these features (which are uncommon in most cognitive modeling approaches), there are many theoretical challenges still to be faced to allow these features to interact in useful ways and to characterize what may be gained by including these features.},
