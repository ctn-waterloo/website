    abstract={
              Emergent communication in artificial agents has been studied to
              understand language evolution, as well as to develop artificial
              systems that learn to communicate with humans. We show that
              agents performing a cooperative navigation task in various
              gridworld environments learn an interpretable communication
              protocol that enables them to efficiently, and in many cases,
              optimally, solve the task. An analysis of the agents' policies
              reveals that emergent signals spatially cluster the state space,
              with signals referring to specific locations and spatial
              directions such as \emph{left}, \emph{up}, or \emph{upper left
              room}. Using populations of agents, we show that the emergent
    protocol has basic compositional structure, thus exhibiting a core property
    of natural language.}
