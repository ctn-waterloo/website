    abstract={Spatial cognition relies on an internal map-like representation
of space provided by hippocampal place cells, which in turn
are thought to rely on grid cells as a basis. Spatial Semantic Pointers (SSP) have been introduced as a way to represent
continuous spaces and positions via the activity of a spiking
neural network. In this work, we further develop SSP representation to replicate the firing patterns of grid cells. This
adds biological realism to the SSP representation and links biological findings with a larger theoretical framework for representing concepts. Furthermore, replicating grid cell activity
with SSPs results in greater accuracy when constructing place
cells. Improved accuracy is a result of grid cells forming the optimal basis for decoding positions and place cell output. Our
results have implications for modelling spatial cognition and
more general cognitive representations over continuous variables.},
