  abstract={We discuss the notion of "discrete function bases" with a particular focus on the discrete basis derived from the Legendre Delay Network (LDN). We characterize the performance of these bases in a delay computation task, and as fixed temporal convolutions in neural networks. Networks using fixed temporal convolutions are conceptually simple and yield state-of-the-art results in tasks such as psMNIST.}
