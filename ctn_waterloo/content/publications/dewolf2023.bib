	abstract={In this paper, we present a fully spiking neural network running on Intel’s Loihi chip for operational space control of a simulated 7-DOF arm. Our approach uniquely combines neural engineering and deep learning methods to successfully implement position and orientation control of the end effector. The development process involved 4 stages: 1) Designing a node-based network architecture implementing an analytical solution; 2) developing rate neuron networks to replace the nodes; 3) retraining the network to handle spiking neurons and temporal dynamics; and ﬁnally 4) adapting the network for the speciﬁc hardware constraints of the Loihi. We benchmark the controller on a center-out reaching task, using the deviation of the end effector from the ideal trajectory as our evaluation metric. The RMSE of the ﬁnal neuromorphic controller running on Loihi is only slightly worse than the analytic solution, with 4.13% more deviation from the ideal trajectory, and uses two orders of magnitude less energy per inference than standard hardware solutions. While qualitative discrepancies remain, we ﬁnd these results support both our approach and the potential of neuromorphic controllers. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most advanced neuromorphic implementation of neurorobotics developed to date.}
