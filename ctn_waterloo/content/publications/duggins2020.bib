    abstract={Decision making (DM) requires the coordination of anatomically and functionally distinct cortical and subcortical areas.
While previous computational models have studied these subsystems in isolation, few models explore how DM holistically
arises from their interaction. We propose a spiking neuron
model that unifies various components of DM, then show that
the model performs an inferential decision task in a human-like
manner. The model (a) includes populations corresponding to
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, right inferior
frontal cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, and basal ganglia;
(b) is constructed using 8000 leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons
with 7 million connections; and (c) realizes dedicated cognitive
operations such as weighted valuation of inputs, accumulation
of evidence for multiple choice alternatives, competition between potential actions, dynamic thresholding of behavior, and
urgency-mediated modulation. We show that the model reproduces reaction time distributions and speed-accuracy tradeoffs
from humans performing the task. These results provide behavioral validation for tasks that involve slow dynamics and
perceptual uncertainty; we conclude by discussing how additional tasks, constraints, and metrics may be incorporated into
this initial framework.}
