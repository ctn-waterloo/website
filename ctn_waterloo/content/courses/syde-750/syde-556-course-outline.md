    Main resource: “Neural Engineering: Representation, Computation and Dynamics in Neurobiological Systems”, Chris Eliasmith and Charles Anderson, 2003. MIT Press. On Reserve in Library.

    Optional: “How to Build a Brain”, Chris Eliasmith, 2012. Oxford University Press.

-   **Course Description**  
    This course examines a general framework for modeling
    computation by neurobiological systems with an emphasis on quantitative
    formulations. Particular emphasis will be placed on understanding computation,
    representation, and dynamics in such systems. Students will learn how the
    fundamentals of signal processing, control theory and statistical inference,
    can be applied to modeling sensory, motor, and cognitive systems.

-   **Prerequisites:**  
    Knowing how to program using `numpy` in Python is highly recommended.  Familiarity with calculus and linear algebra is required.

## Schedule
See the course syllabus provided above.

## Grading

The course requires five assignments from all students (100% for 556, 80% for 750) and a final project (20%) from students taking 750. There is an option for 556 students to do a project in place of the final assignment. Assignments are due electronically by 11:59pm of the due date. Late assignments lose 1 mark per day and may be at most seven days late. Assignments are to be done individually (everyone writes their own code and answers questions themselves).
