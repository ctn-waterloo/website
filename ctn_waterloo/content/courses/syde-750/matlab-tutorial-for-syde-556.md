title: Matlab Tutorial for SYDE 556

If you have absolutely no familiarity with Matlab, you should follow the
tutorial on the Mathworks site [here](http://www.mathworks.com/products/education/student_version/tutorials/launchpad.shtml).



If you have some familiarity and want to brush up, or get a good overview of
Matlab's typical functionality, I suggest going over one or two of these
resources:





  * [University of Waterloo](http://saw.uwaterloo.ca/matlab/)


  * [Mathworks](http://www.mathworks.com/academia/student_center/tutorials/launchpad.html)


  * [University of British Columbia](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/cavers/MatlabGuide/guide.html)


  * [University of Florida](http://www.math.ufl.edu/help/matlab-tutorial/)


  * [University of New Hampshire](http://spicerack.sr.unh.edu/%7Emathadm/tutorial/software/matlab/)



I highly recommend reading this document: [Matlab array manipulation tips and
tricks](http://home.online.no/%7Epjacklam/matlab/doc/mtt/index.html).



To review some Matlab functions relevant to this course, I suggest doing the
following (in no particular order):




1. Play with the singular value decomposition (SVD) demo that comes with
Matlab. At the prompt type 'help eigshow' and then 'eigshow' (to run the
demo). We use SVD often, so it will help to familiar with what it tells you
about a matrix.



2. You can look at doing Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) in Matlab by typing
'playshow sunspots' at the command line. We will be using Fourier analysis on
occasion.



3. If you want to familiarize yourself with similar applications to what we
will be doing, you can read "Neural Network Toolbox: Getting Started" in the
Matlab help files. We won't be doing artificial networks, but many of the
techniques are related.



4. You can always [download](http://nengo.ca) the software based on the book
and play with it (help files are included). Looking at the code may help, but
it will be different from how I expect you to write it in a number of places.
Do not copy any code you find.
