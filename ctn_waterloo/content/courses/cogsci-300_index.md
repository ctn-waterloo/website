Your commentary should identify the claim that interests you and the strongest evidence for and against it. The purpose of these commentaries is to ensure that everyone comes to class prepared for discussion. There is no penalty for missing 3. There will be approximately 20 over the term. Commentaries should be handed in on paper.

### Case Studies

You are required to find material on a case study of intelligence (machine, human, or animal) not covered in class. A list of keywords is linked below. When you have decided on a keyword, you must inform the instructor via email and it will be removed from the list of available keywords. You can also propose keywords not on the list. For the case study, students must prepare a 5 min presentation (2-3 slides) to present in class, and hand in a 1 page write up on the case. Students can request a presentation date in the scheduled dates on a first come first served basis.
