Chris and Michael have finished a tutorial on Neurosymbolic Methods for NeuroMatch, a website providing high quality training in neuroscience, AI, and machine learning. 

You can find their [tutorial here](https://neuroai.neuromatch.io/tutorials/W2D2_NeuroSymbolicMethods/chapter_title.html), which is part of a longer multi-week course on combining theoretical neuroscience and AI methods.

Neuromatch provides training in the computational sciences, and this NeuroAI course is one of two neuroscience related ones currently running.
