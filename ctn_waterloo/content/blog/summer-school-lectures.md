Unfortunately the Nengo Summer School had to be cancelled this year due to COVID-19, but that doesn't mean you can't get a taste of what you'll learn at Brain Camp!

Chris and Terry have been hard at work recording a set of lectures covering the topics typically presented in the first few days of the summer school.
The videos are freely available to view [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYLu6sY3jnoXTrkfA_WMn0nF_FGz-MaiJ).
While no substitute for the hand-on experience of the actual summer school, these lectures and tutorials give an excellent introduction to the Neural Engineering Framework and how to develop spiking neural network models using Nengo.
