This is our latest ‘overview’ paper. This one is targeted at the neuromorphics community, but also can be seen as a recent update to the latest NEF theoretical advances. <br/> 
It covers how any linear synapse can be used in a network, and the ‘delay network’, a recent advance that not only explains time cells in the brain, but is setting state-of-the-art records in a wide variety of machine learning contexts.<br>
This is coming out in the 2021 Springer Handbook for Neuromorphics.
