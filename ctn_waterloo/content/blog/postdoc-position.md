title: Postdoc Position in Large-scale Brain Modeling
author: Chris Eliasmith 
date: 

Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience, University of Waterloo

We are recruiting for a theoretical neuroscientist interested in building large-scale functional brain models.  The successful candidate will become an integral part of the team that has built the world's largest functional brain model, Spaun. This work was published in Science, and received coverage around the world on CNN, BBC, CBC, and hundreds of other outlets. We are building the next generation of computational platforms to run such models. This position will focus on using  supercomputers (e.g., IBM BlueGene) to run models written in the Nengo environment (http://nengo.ca).  Nengo is a general neural simulation environment that, in addition to Spaun, has been used to simulate adaptive arm controllers, state-of-the-art vision systems, natural language processors, reinforcement learners, and novel robotic controllers among many other projects.  Postdocs will be encouraged to pursue their research program with these state-of-the-art tools.

Qualifications: PhD in theoretical neuroscience or related field; experience with MPI, BlueGene, or other HPC environments desirable; python experience an asset.

Start date: As soon as a suitable candidate is found

Submit: CV, statement of research interests, three references

Duration: 1 year renewable for a 2nd year

Lab: CNRG http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/

Contact: celiasmith@uwaterloo.ca (Chris Eliasmith)

Funding for the position will be provided by TalentEdge (http://www.oce-ontario.org/programs/industry-academic-collaboration/talentedge/fellowships) and a corporate sponsor.
