# This script is used to buid the website in the CI system. It replaces
# the old .travis.yml.
#
# The basic idea is the following: The build system is split into two
# phases. The "first stage" immutably resides on the build server. It
# simply downloads the Git repository with the website into a temporary
# directory and then proceeds to execute the "second stage" build script
# inside a disposable Docker sandbox.
#
# The second stage installs Python dependencies and performs the actual
# build. Once that is done, the first stage resumes and uploads the
# website to the webserver.
#
# This way the code in this repository is completely isolated from the rest of
# the build server. This is less meant as a security measure, and more to
# prevent the website code from accidentially breaking something.
#
# Note that changes to the "first stage" of the build script are not
# automatically reflected on the build server. The build script (as well as the
# webhook server) need to be manually updated by logging into the build
# server.
